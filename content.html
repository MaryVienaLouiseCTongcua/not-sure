 <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
<li><b>Climate change are the long rm shifts in temperatures and weather patterns that can occur over several decades or even longer.</b> Because of Climate change, not only are we getting affected but as well as our animals, the ecosystem, and the planet itself. Despite climate change being already being an known problem, there hasn't changed much over the past years. Which is why the goal here is to bring awareness and stop climate change from destroying our home.</li>

 <h2>What are the Causes of Climate change?</h2>
	 <ul>
    <li> 1. <b>Generating power:</b>  With the need to burn fossil fuels to generate our electricity or heat, this creates a huge amount of global emissions. This creates  a power greenhouse made up of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide which traps the heat of the sun.</li>
    <li> 2. <b>Cutting down Forests:</b> Due to increase of cutting of trees, this causes to take away the tree's ability to keep out emissions out of our atmosphere. This would lead to more carbon dioxide being released and absorbed.</li>
    <li> 3. <b>Transportation:</b> Most of the vehicles being used today require fossil fuels. This leads to transportation being one of the largest contributors for greenhouse gases since it creates a large amount of carbon-dioxide emissions.</li>
    <li> 4. <b>Power Plants:</b>The factories that are seen in the resent world are the reasons why it creates a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Since these plants create half of our electricity, this creates a demand for them to keep on going.</li>
  </ul>
 

 <h2>What are the Effects of Climate change?</h2>
	 <ul>
    <li> 1. <b>Increase in temperatures:</b> The more the greenhouse gases produces, the more the temperature in the global surface increases. Because of the rise of temperature, its getting harder to work outdoors, wildfires spread, and even the Artic is starting to get warmer as days go by.
</li>
    <li> 2. <b>Severe storms:</b> Since the temperature has increased, then that would mean the more moisture evaporates. Its been said that more storms had occurred more often, this would lead to destruction of homes and deaths.</li>
    <li> 3 <b>Health Risks:</b> The impacts of Climate Change is starting to create pollution and diseases which can affect an individual's health both on the mental and physical health.</li>
    <li> 4. <b>Impact on the Ecosystem:</b> Different groups of species are forced to move away from their habitats due to the impact of climate change. As ocean temperatures rises as well, corals are starting to lose their color and started to slowly die. Not only doe this affect their habitats, but also the food and breeding cycle of the species.</li>
  </ul>


 <h2>How we can stop climate change?</h2>
	 <ul>
    <li> 1. <b>Conserving energy:</b> Due to power plants needing to burn more fossil fuels to produce electricity. Some simple actions like using less electricity, turning off lights, and turning off appliances when not needed.
</li>
    <li> 2. <b>Reforestation:</b> Cutting of trees already is a big factor to contributing to climate change. However, planting trees again can help with absorbing carbon dioxide in the environment.</li>
   
 <li> 3. <b>Using new energy sources:</b>Raising awarenessThe most important of all is to raise awareness to various people around the world about climate change and its effects. Educating and advocating others about these serious situations and to help support environmental protection for the ecosystem.</li>
